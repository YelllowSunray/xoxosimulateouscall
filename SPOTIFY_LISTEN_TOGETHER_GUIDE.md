### "Music plays but I can't hear it"

- Solution: Person A should use headphones/AirPods to hear privately
- OR: Use a speaker that both people can hear

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **For Laptop + Laptop:**
- One person selects their laptop as the device
- Other person also selects that same laptop
- First person uses headphones to hear

### **For Laptop + iPhone:**
- iPhone user opens Spotify app and plays a song
- Both users select the iPhone as the device
- iPhone user uses AirPods/headphones to hear

### **For In-Person Hangouts:**
- One person connects a Bluetooth speaker
- Play Spotify on that speaker
- Both users control the speaker from their devices
- Everyone hears the same music!

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### **Console Logs to Look For:**

Press **F12** to open browser console:

```
✅ "🎵 Initializing Spotify Connect API - Universal Remote Control Mode"
✅ "🔄 Check for Devices" should show your devices
✅ When playing a song: "Received Spotify sync: play_track"
```

### **Visual Indicators:**
